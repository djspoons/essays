# Installation

I mostly followed the directions listed here:

- https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll
- https://jekyllrb.com/tutorials/using-jekyll-with-bundler/

Once you have Ruby installed, you should be able to test locally by running these commands:

```
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
